# Farmers-Market
A class system that represents produce available at a farmer's market.

I wrote this for a job I applied to in 2021. Though underwhelming, this code achieved its purpose of securing my first software position as an Entry-Level Dev.

I won't be accepting changes to this project, as it represents years of hard work and challenges faced finally starting to come together.

Requirements are listed in FarmersMarket.pdf
